## MOOC_dataset
 This project aims to verify which variables are most relevant to determine the success of students MOOC type courses.

# Introduction

The dropout rate for distance learning courses is very high and the success rate for 
students is low. Success here will be defined when the student receives the course certificate. 
Variables such as sex, education level, number of interactions with the platform and country of origin will
be considered.
 
 # Data
 
The data used were made available by the University of Havard and 
refer to a set of student results from the year 2013. 
The database can be accessed at the following address https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/mxhx

# Methodologies

Binary classification models will be fitted to the dataset. 
The model with the best results will be used to create an App 
that allows you to see how each of the variables changes the student's probability of success.
All of them were implemented using R.

# Algorithms
Logistic Regression

Desicion Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting
